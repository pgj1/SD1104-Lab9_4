9_4 Lab Practice Creating Dynamic HTML
Lesson Time: 2 Hours
In this lab, we want you to use StringBuilder and File to generate .html pages. You’ll build up a .html file using 
StringBuilder and then generate the .html file.

Your HTML page will including
● a <h1> heading element with a title
● 3 unordered list items, <ul>

The content of the H1 text and the unordered list will come from typing text into the C# console 
when the code executes. You may, if you wish, add additional HTML elements to the output.
